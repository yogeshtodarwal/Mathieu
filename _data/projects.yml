- name: Development of Machine Learning Techniques to Address the Diastereoselectivity for oxazole Catalyzed Asymmetric Reactions
  descr: "Description: Design of enantioselective reaction has been always a very exciting and challenging domain in
chemistry. The origin of selectivity is often guided by proper choice of asymmetric catalyst. Transition state
modelling using Density Functional Theory has been the standard way out to decipher the origin of selectivity.
Recently statistical modelling using linear regression method in chemical reactions has been emerging as a
powerful tool to model chemical reactions. In this study, we are trying to develop machine learning methods
(Feature Selection and Neural Network) in the context of chemical catalysis. 
\n
Asymmetric catalysis using chiral oxazole ligands has been established as a promising methodology in
cyclopropanation, aziridination, arylation, diels-alder reactions. In this project, we have extracted information
in form of quantum chemical features and map on to enantiomeric excess by employing neural network tools.
We have built a generalized model for an asymmetric reaction using chiral oxazole ligands. An extensive dataset
has been formed from experimentally validated catalysts. The parameters (steric and electronic) are selected
from the optimized catalyst geometry. Feature selection algorithm provides us the chemical insight from the
whole dataset. The high ranked parameters have been used for neural network modelling. We have been able
to predict enantioselectivity efficiently by using this tool. Simultaneously we have also expanded the reaction
library using this model and came up with some excellent ligands in terms of enantioselectivity. In this way, we
have designed a powerful tool in this study which can be used for a wide variety of chemical problems."

- name: Mechanistic investigation of enantioselective formation of quaternary carbon by combination of photoredox and organocatalysis
  descr: "Merging photoredox with organocatalysis has gained importance in the asymmetric alkylation of
aldehydes, formation of enantioselective quaternary carbons, direct β-functionalization of saturated carbonyl
compounds, etc. Till date, there has been significant development on modeling catalyst to give enantioselective
quaternary carbon formation by exploring polar reactivity, However, exploiting radicals is not much successful
despite the fact that they are more reactive. In this prospect, Murphy et al. in April 2017 have developed a
reaction to form a quaternary carbon which is important to the modern organic chemist.
Formation of quaternary carbon mainly takes place via two important pathways: radical-radical cross-coupling
or conjugate addition of radical to enone followed by intermolecular single electron transfer (SET). In both the
cases, it was found that activation barrier for stereoselective transition state is not important as compare to
SET barriers. Further, a fragment-based model was developed to account for an effect of substrate on
intramolecular SET. This model is validated with experiments for a similar reaction. A major challenge in this
project involves dealing SET barrier that falls in negative Marcus region. In summary, calculation manifest that
reaction goes through reductive quenching pathways via small preference for radical conjugate addition over
radical-radical cross coupling mechanism."
